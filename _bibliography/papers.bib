  abstract  = {We propose a method to probe and control the interactions between an ensemble of magnetic impurities in a superconductor via microwave radiation. Our method relies upon the presence of subgap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states associated with the impurities. Depending on the sign of the detuning, radiation generates either a ferro- or antiferromagnetic contribution to the exchange interaction. This contribution can bias the statistics of the random exchange constants stemming from the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction. Moreover, by measuring the microwave response at the YSR resonance, one gains information about the magnetic order of the impurities. To this end, we estimate the absorption coefficient as well as the achievable strength of the microwave-induced YSR interactions using off-resonant radiation. The ability to utilize microwave fields to both probe and control impurity spins in a superconducting host may open new paths to studying metallic spin glasses.},

  abstract = {Guiding electronic waves in a manner similar to photon transmission in optical fibers is key for developing the electron-optics toolbox. Here we outline a `weak guiding' approach, in which efficient diffraction around disorder results in low-loss, high-finesse electron guiding. We describe an implementation of this scheme for guiding along a narrow-width line gate in gapless and gapped graphene. A simple model for weak guiding, which relies on the Jackiw-Rebbi midgap states, is introduced and solved. The weak-guiding modes are shown to exist for confining potential of either sign and no matter how strong or weak. Modes evolve in a cyclic manner upon varying gate potential, repeatedly sweeping the Dirac gap and becoming dispersionless (flat band) at certain magic values of gate potential. Large mode widths facilitate diffraction around disorder in the core region, enabling exceptionally large mean free paths and long-range ballistic propagation. },

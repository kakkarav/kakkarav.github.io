Hi there, I am Best.

I am a PhD student in [Yao group](https://quantumoptics.physics.berkeley.edu/) at University of California, Berkeley.
As a theoretical physicist, I study how disorders and strong interactions in superconductor can give rise to exotic phases of matter, using numerical and theoretical tools.

I received my undergraduate degree in physics from MIT in 2016 under the guidance of Professor [Leonid Levitov](http://www.mit.edu/~levitov/). 

On a fun side, I truly enjoy movies, drawing, and making coffee.
I was born and raised in Bangkok, [Thailand](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-places-to-visit-in-thailand).

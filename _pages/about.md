Hi there, I am Best.

I am a theoretical physicist by training, an artist at heart, and a technologist by serendipity.

I am a PhD student in [Yao group](https://quantumoptics.physics.berkeley.edu/) at University of California, Berkeley.

I received my undergraduate degree in physics from MIT in 2016 under the guidance of Professor [Leonid Levitov](http://www.mit.edu/~levitov/).

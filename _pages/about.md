I am a PhD student in [Yao group](https://quantumoptics.physics.berkeley.edu/) at University of California, Berkeley, and received my undergraduate degree in physics from MIT in 2016 under the guidance of Professor [Leonid Levitov](http://www.mit.edu/~levitov/). My research focuses on the effect of disorder on the quantum systems in condensed matter such as Quantum Hall effect and superconductors.

Outside theoretical physics, I am fascinated by arts and technologies. I love tinkering with hardware and experimenting with various open-source software and technologies.
